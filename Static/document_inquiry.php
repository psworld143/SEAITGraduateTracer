                                    across all college programs, supported by various government sectors and NGOs.</p>

                                <h3>Our History</h3>
                                <p>South East Asian Institute of Technology, Inc., affectionately known as SEAIT, began
                                    its journey in February 2006. Unlike a typical foundation story, ours unfolded like
                                    a dramatic play, with all the elements of a grand performance. The curtains opened
                                    slowly, revealing our humble beginnings.</p>
                                <p>Initially occupying a rented space at a Shell Gasoline station in Tupi, SEAIT catered
                                    to a small population of vocational students. The founders, Mr. Reynaldo S. Tamayo
                                    and Mrs. Rochelle P. Tamayo, faced numerous challenges, particularly regarding the
                                    learning environment. Despite these obstacles, they remained steadfast in their
                                    commitment to providing quality education.</p>
                                <p>SEAIT began by offering technical and vocational courses, such as Computer
                                    Programming NC IV and Computer Hardware Servicing NC II. A pivotal moment came when
                                    the Technical Education Skills Development Authority (TESDA) granted permission to
                                    offer Hotel and Restaurant Management. Soon after, the Commission on Higher
                                    Education (CHED) approved our first four-year program, the Bachelor of Science in
                                    Information Technology (BSIT), attracting a broader audience.</p>
                                <p>Our momentum continued as CHED authorized a laddered Bachelor of Science in Hotel and
                                    Restaurant Management and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, majoring
                                    in Marketing Management. Within two years, we expanded to include Bachelor of
                                    Elementary Education and Bachelor of Secondary Education, majoring in English and
                                    Mathematics. Subsequently, we successfully introduced programs in Criminology,
                                    Agriculture, and Civil Engineering.</p>
                                <p>In June 2016, we received government recognition from the Department of Education to
                                    operate K-12 programs, including kindergarten, junior high, and senior high school,
                                    which saw steady growth in enrollment.</p>
                                <p>This year, we proudly broaden our offerings with new degree programs:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bachelor of Science in Tourism Management (BSTM)</li>
                                    <li>Bachelor of Early Childhood Education (BECE)</li>
                                    <li>Bachelor of Science in Accounting Information Systems (BSAIS)</li>
                                    <li>Bachelor of Science in Public Administration (BSPA)</li>
                                    <li>Bachelor of Science in Fisheries (BSF)</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>From the dedicated efforts of the Tamayo family, SEAIT has evolved into a vibrant
                                    community of administrators, faculty, students, and local partners, all united in
                                    the pursuit of education and meaningful contributions to society. Our story
                                    continues to unfold, driven by our commitment to growth and excellence.</p>
